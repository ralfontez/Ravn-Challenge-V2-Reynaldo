# Ravn Challenge!

This is the project in which we demonstrate some programing skills in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and Apollo Graphql. In this project, we get the information from [swapi](https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index), which is a start war API. The queries were made by [Apollo Graphql](https://www.apollographql.com/). 

# Setup/Running instruction

To test the **Ravn Challenge**, you need to follow this steps:

 1. First of all, clone from GitHub: `git clone git@github.com:ralfontez/Ravn-Challenge-V2-Reynaldo.git`
 2. Then install from the directory **Ravn-Challenge-V2-Reynaldo** with: `npm install`
 3. Now, you can type on the terminal: `npm start` into **Ravn-Challenge-V2-Reynaldo** folder. 
 4. Go to Url: `http://localhost:3000/`

## Project description

## Assumptions

The font was downloaded from [fontsfree.net](http://fontsfree.net/sf-pro-display-regular-font-download.html). Then was put into a new **./src/fonts** folder, and some instructions were put into **./index.js** and **./index.css**.
